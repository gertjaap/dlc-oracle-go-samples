# Examples of using the Discreet Log Contract Oracle library (Go)

This repository contains examples of using the DLC Oracle library to create oracles.

* [Console](console/) - A simple example of using the code by getting the values to sign from the console.
* [REST API](restapi/) - An example of an oracle publishing at set intervals, that exposes the R-points and signatures via a REST api.
