* [Console](console/) - A simple example of using the code by getting the values to sign from the console.
* [REST API](restapi/) - An example of an oracle publishing at set intervals, that exposes the R-points and signatures via a REST api.
* [Tutorial](tutorial/) - The full code to the [step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/mit-dci/dlc-oracle-go/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md) for using this library
